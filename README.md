# Moksha

This is an experimental video game written in rust. Building an editor of some sorts is the first priority; the actual game will follow. Keep note that this can be used as a library but is not intended as such since the code quality and feature set has a long way to go before being library worthy.

After many attempts and blunders, I have finally settled for wasm-bindgen. My first attempt was to try three-rs (<https://gitlab.com/nrayamajhee/moksha-three>). It was a good starting point, but I eventually learned some WebGL and GLSL, which led me to abandon three-rs's three-js like abstraction. I then thought, I would instead write my own vulkan renderer (<https://gitlab.com/nrayamajhee/moksha-vk>), which turned out to be an agonizing journey that was well beyond my capabilities. Hence, I am here, using wasm-bindgen's webgl binding. Hopefully someday WebGPU kicks off and drags me back to vulkan like code base.

## Preview 

The entire project is deployed at <http://moksha.rayamajhee.com>. This is continuously deployed with every commit in `master`.

This was the initial setup for `moksha-three`. My goal is to eventually write abstractions (editors, shaders, etc.) to be able to recreate this:

This is what the editor currently looks like:

## How to?

### Setup:

To install `rust`. Follow the `custom` setup and choose `nightly` after running the following command:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

`rust nightly` is a must because I use `maud` for templating which uses procedural macros.

(Alternative) If you run Arch Linux, the following will do.

```bash
pacman -S rustup
rustup default nightly
```

To install wasm-pack:

```bash
curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh 
```

(Alternative) If you are on Arch, you can find [wasm-pack](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wasm-pack/) in `AUR`.

### Run the game:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nrayamajhee/moksha.git
cd moksha
./moksha build
./mksha serve
```

### Run tests:

 Tests are non-existent at the moment so I will revisit this later.
 
```bash
./moksha test
```

Running test headless on `firefox` seems to break CI/CD at the moment, so I use `chrome` for testing.

### Generate docs:

```bash
./moksha docs
```

The `moksha` script runs basic `wasm-pack` commands. Check it for further details. This is the current options:

```bash
./moksha
moksha [(w)atch | (b)uild | (c)lippy | (d)ocs | (s)erve | (t)est]
```

## Rust-lang usage, browsers, and performance

Although, I have been learning rust for a while and was writing some C/C++ in the past, I am in no capability to judge how idiomatic my code is nor how healthy its memory management is. This program, although robust to my eyes does have some memory issues. I can't quite figure out if its my code, or firefox's WebGL driver, but I suspect there's some memory leaks as firefox's memory usage only climbs when run. Chrome, on the other hand, works perfectly fine. Also note that firefox on linux has very poor WebGL performance. There are multiple issues on Bugzilla about this. Although firefox is my browser of choice, I recommend running chrome for maximum performance.

Due to wasm-bingen's lack of support for rust lifetime annotations, I make heavy use of `Rc<RefCell>` pattern to pass the structs to event handlers. Although, I can ditch wasm-bindgen's javascript endpoint and use lifetimes notations, I think it is better to expose all my structs and functions to javascript so that if anyone wants to use this as a javascript library, it is as feature rich and complete.

The core engine strives to be data-oriented (ECS like). I am no expert here and although I should have chosen a rust library that already provides efficient data structures, I refuse to do so mainly because for ergonomic reasons and my personal hubris. This is my personal attempt at maintaining a fairly large code, so it will intentionally carry my crude vocabulary. I am developing this as I am learning WebGL/OpenGL so many internal states will move around as I learn various approaches to manage them.

## Resources

The following websites were invaluable in making this possible:
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial)
- [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)

There are still a lot of things to be implemented from Learn OpenGL. My current goal is to complete PBR and Deferred Shading for the editor before developing game logic.
